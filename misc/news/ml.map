# This file should be installed in /etc/news
#
# It is used by newsgate to redirect news posting to the listed newsgroups
# to their respective mailing lists.  Users don't call newsgate directly,
# it is invoked by the news server.
#
# For INN, add this line to /etc/news/newsfeeds:
#
#   ml-gateway!:!*,ml.*/!local\
#        :Tp:/usr/bin/newsgate -log /var/log/news/gate.log
#
# (the leading !* entry is to remove all ME: default settings)
#
# You must have sendmail correctly configured on the machine you're using
# newsgate for this to work.  The "ml" prefix here is just my convention
# for mail-lists that I feed to my local news server.
