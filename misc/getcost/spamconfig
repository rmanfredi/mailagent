# Revision 3.0.1.1  1998/03/31  15:30:20  ram
# patch59: created
#
#
# A sample ~/.spamconfig file that has proven useful to me.
# Since some spammers will now undoubtedly check their messages against
# this rule file, it will require adjustments over time.
# In any case, do not widely distribute your scoring patterns.

###############################################################################
#
# The general form of this file is (there are exceptions, though -- see below):
#
#	[ section name ]
#	pattern1		score1
#	pattern2		score2
#	pattern3		score3
#	...
#
# Patterns are Perl regular expressions, and are case-insensitive.  Note
# that a line continuation character does NOT exist; everything must fit
# onto one line.
#
# A score is simply a numeric number.  The score is summed with all
# other scores to form the message cost.  Use negative numbers for SPAM
# phrases, and positive numbers for non-SPAM phrases.
#
# Within a section, patterns are applied in the order they are listed.
#
# Comments, of course, begin with a "#", and MUST occur at the beginning
# of a line (leading whitespace is allowed, though).  You cannot put
# comments at the end of a line.  A comment covers an entire line.
#
# Totally blank lines are ignored.
#
###############################################################################
#
# "name" is your email address (basically, your login name), as a
# regular expression.  It is used when the "-m" option is used, to
# increase the cost if this "name" pattern appears in the To: header.
#
# NOTE: This section can be omitted by most people, as the default is
# your login name followed by an "@" sign.  It is listed here for
# documentation reasons, just in case someone has an obscure reason for
# using something other than the login name.
#
# NOTE: This section is different than most, in that this section
# consists of a single line, which contains just an email address
# pattern.
#
[ name ]

# yourlogin\@

#
# "good sites" are sites from which mail is always (blindly) accepted.  The
# following patterns are matched against the From: or Reply-To: headers.
# However, "good sites" are matched only if:
#
#	1. These headers do not contain more than one "@" characters.
#	2. These headers do not contain "mailer-daemon" (questionable).
#	3. An earlier From: or Reply-To: header has not already matched a
#	   score pattern from the "sender scores" section (see below).

# "relay scores" are matched against the "received" header line.
#
# Warning: be careful in adding lines here.  Many spammers forge the
# message headers, so blindly adding relay hosts here doesn't always
# work.  Generally, the host that connects to the HP mail relay is a
# good candidate, assuming that the host isn't a major backbone/mail
# relay host.  Any other hosts are suspect (but adding them often
# doesn't hurt).

# "body text" contains patterns to be matched against each line of the
# message body.  The score of the first pattern that matches will be
# used; once a match is found, no other patterns will be checked.
#
# Remember, patterns are checked in the order in which they appear.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: unlike other sections, the Perl regular expressions
# here must contain Perl-style regular expression delimiters (e.g.,
# "/foo/" instead of "foo", like all other regular expressions above).
# This is done to give greater flexibility (like case-sensitive
# matches or multiple patterns).
#
# In the body, a score of zero ("0") is special; it causes pattern
# matching to stop at the current line (if the pattern matches).  No
# other lines in the message body will be checked.  This is useful for
# stopping scanning when (for example) a shar file is detected.  Also,
# assigning a very large positive or negative number will have a similar
# effect, except that the message cost will be adjusted accordingly
# (this is useful for forcing a message to be considered as SPAM or
# not-SPAM, and stopping scanning at the same time).
#
# Also, scoring also stops if the score goes above 1000000 or below
# -100000.  Another way to stop further lines from being processed is to
# add a very large number to the score to get the score above 1000000
# (assuming that you want the message to always be accepted).
