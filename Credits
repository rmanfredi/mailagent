INTRO

This version of mailagent has been written by Raphael Manfredi based on
previous work from Larry Wall, published in dist-2.0.

HISTORY

The mailagent history is somewhat linked to the dist package history. When
I discovered dist-2.0 in August 1990 and began extending metaconfig and the
pat tools, I also began extending Larry Wall's mailagent, which was included
in dist-2.0 along with the mailpatch command.

I started adding mailhelp, maildist and maillist because I needed them, and
then left France in March 1991 to go write an Eiffel compiler until March 1993.
Since I was getting a lot of mail at ISE, I felt the need for a real mail
filter and not just an @SH command processor. Moreover, I was getting tired of
having "Command mails" showing in my mailbox. The only mail filter I knew at
that time was ELM's, and it was not meeting my requirements.

Therefore, I started extending mailagent late 1991 up to the point where it
became a real and flexible mail filter (according to my standards anyway)
and since I thought others would like to play with it too, I released it
as a beta 3.0 (known as version 2.9) on comp.sources.misc in July 1992 after
7 months of hard work.

I got a lot of positive feedback on this program, and therefore I continued
to extend it. I also began to see some limitations in the 2.9 version and
started adding new features (like perl escapes, user-defined commands,
etc...). I originally intended to make version 3.0 part of dist-3.0, but
mailagent was starting to get a life of its own and not really a part of dist.
However, @SH commands like ``package'' are meant to be used in conjunction
with metaconfig, one of dist's components.

In March 1993, I left ISE and returned to France to join A.C.R.I.. Although
mailagent-3.0 was virtually finished by that time, I needed to release dist-3.0
first due to some intensive user-pressure ;-). It's only late October 1993 that
I found the time to finalize the manual page and add all the small features
stacked in my TODO list...

CREDITS

My first thanks will go to Larry Wall <lwall@netlabs.com> who wrote perl
in the first place. I would never have dreamed of implementing mailagent
from scratch if perl had not been invented.

Then I'd like to thank all the early mailagent users for their useful input,
suggestions, encouragement, contributions, constructive criticism or bug
reports, and especially (by alphabetical order on the first name):
