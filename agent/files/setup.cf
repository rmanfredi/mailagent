# Types of various configuration parameters. A lowercase f/d indicates an
# optional file/directory, or one that will be created on demand. An uppercase
# F/D means a mandatory file/directory that should exist.
#
# It is possible to further specify an underlying directory for the file
# or directory by following the type with a value between parenthesis, as in:
#
#        mailbox = f ($maildrop)
#
# to say for instance that the mailbox setting in the config file really
# indicates a file lying under the maildrop setting. A variable name is
# interpreted in the cf package, NOT in the cfset, since it is assummed to
# be a configuration variable. It can be fully qualified if it is not.
# It is also possible to put a plain string here, since the value will
# be interpolated in "" context.
#
# By default, files are anchored under the home directory unless they start
# with a /.
#
# When using 'mailagent -I', a mandatory directory will be created, while a
# mandatory file will be copied from a template lying in the privlib directory
# when specified; otherwise, it is created with a null size.
