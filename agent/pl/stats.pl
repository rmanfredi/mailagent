;# Handle the mailagent statistics file. This file is known as the statfile
;# in the configuration file (typically mailagent.st in the spool directory).
;# This file contains a summary of the action taken by the mailagent. The very
;# first line contains: mailstat: <timestamp> which is the date the statistics
;# started.
;#
;# The following format is used for each records:
;#
;#    <timestamp> 0 0
;#    <# of mails processed> <# commands run> <# of failures> <# of bytes>
;#    <rule number> <mode> <number of matches>
;#    "default" <number of matches>
;#    "vacation" <number of vaction messages sent>
;#    "seen" <number of messages already seen>
;#    "saved" <number of messages saved by default>
;#    <command name> <mode> <number of execution>
;#    !<command name> <mode> <number of failures>
;#    @<command name> <mode> <tag> <number of execution>
;#    %@<command name> <mode> <tag> <number of non-executed commands>
;#    --------
;#    <output of rule dumping>
;#    ++++++++
;#
;# The leading timestamp records the stamp on the rule file, followed by two
;# zeros (currently unused locations, reserved for future use, as they say).
;#
;# The number of mails processed is only stored to check the consistency of the
;# statistics file. Likewise, the number of commands run and the number of
;# failed commands are used to check the logging accuracy.
;#
;# Lines starting with a number indicate a match for a particular rule, in
;# a given mode. The "default", "vacation" and "seen" lines record the activity
;# of the default action, the vacation mode or the messages already processed
;# which come back.
;#
;# Commands are also logged. They are always spelled upper-cased. If the line
;# starts with a '!', it indicates a failure. If the character '@' is found
;# before the command name, it indicates a ONCE command. The tag part of the
;# identification is logged, but not the name (which is likely to be an e-mail
;# address anyway, whereas the tag identifies the command itself). The lines
;# starting with '%' also give the number of ONCE commands which were not
;# executed because the retry time was not reached.
;#
;# Below the dashed line, all the rules are dumped in order, and are separated
;# by a blank line. These are the rules listed in the rule file and they are
;# given for information purposes only, when reporting statistics. It ends with
;# a plus line.
;#
;# Whenever the rule file is updated, another record is started after having
;# been diffing the rules we have parsed with the rules dumped in the statistics
;# file.
;#
;# In order to improve performances, the statistics file is cached in memory.
;# Only the last record is read, up to the dashed-line. The data structures
;# used are:
;#
;#     @stats'Top: the top seven fields of the record:
;#         (time, 0, 0, processed, run, failed, bytes)
;#     %stats'Rule: indexed by <N>+mode, the number of matches
;#     %stats'Special: indexed by "default", "vacation", "saved" or "seen"
;#     %stats'Command: indexed by name+mode, the total number of runs
;#         this accounts for ONCE commands as well.
;#     %stats'FCommand: indexed by name+mode, the number of failures
;#         this accounts for ONCE commands as well.
;#     %stats'Once: indexed by name+mode+tag, the number of succesful runs
;#     %stats'ROnce: indexed by name+mode+tag, number of non-executed comands
;#
