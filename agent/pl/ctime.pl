;# ctime.pl is a simple Perl emulation for the well known ctime(3C) function.
#
# This library is no longer being maintained, and is included for backward
# compatibility with Perl 4 programs which may require it.
#
# In particular, this should not be used as an example of modern Perl
# programming techniques.
#
# Suggested alternative: the POSIX ctime function
